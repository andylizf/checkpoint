# GDB Tutorial Example

This example is adapted from UC Berkeley's CS61C course [Lab 2](https://cs61c.org/fa24/labs/lab02/#exercise-2-intro-to-gdb). While the workspace files are from Berkeley's course materials, we've enhanced the learning experience with Checkpoint's interactive mission system.

## What's Different?

The original lab requires students to:
1. Keep the instructions open in one window
2. Run GDB commands in another window
3. Manually copy each command into a text file
4. Deal with a basic checker that can't recognize advanced GDB commands

With Checkpoint, you can:
1. See instructions right in your terminal
2. Get instant feedback on your progress
3. Focus on learning GDB instead of managing windows and files

No more juggling between windows or fighting with inflexible checkers! ðŸŽ¯
